<!-- These pages were auto-generated from content stored in content.py and using the python file compile.py together with several html templates written with jinja2 and stored in the /templates directory.
I did my Stage 3 Project like this because I wanted to apply my knowledge about Classes and OOP actively. If there are any comments or tips how to better auto-generate pages, I'd be extremely glad to learn more from a savy reviewer! -->
