My IPND final project
---------

This is my final project for the Udacity Introduction to Programming Nanodegree. 
I made a website by collecting together all the different stages that I did during the ND.
Feel free to leave a note, I'm glad for comments and tips that can help me improve!

The website is up and accessible here: http://ipnd-all.appspot.com/

There's also a file in the repository that explains my process more in detail in case someone is interested to take a look: INFO.txt
